# Prompt 02: Dashboard Empty States (UX)

**Role:** Lead Product Designer
**Task ID:** P2-004
**Objective:** Provide guidance and premium placeholders for new or data-light accounts.

---

### A) Description
A premium experience never shows a blank white screen. This task implements editorial empty states that guide the user back to the Wizard or suggest next steps when no data is available.

### B) Purpose & Goals
- [ ] Design minimalist "Consultant Illustration" placeholders (line drawings) for each tab.
- [ ] Overview: "Your strategic roadmap is being generated. Complete the wizard to see your command center."
- [ ] Tasks: "High-velocity actions appear here once your strategy is locked."
- [ ] Systems: "Selected AI engines will appear here after architecture selection."

### C) UI/UX Layout
- **Style:** Matches the "Charon" editorial aesthetic (Inter + Playfair Display).
- **CTA:** Every empty state must have a clear "Primary Action" button (e.g., "Return to Wizard" or "Generate Tasks").

### D) Success Criteria
- [ ] First-time users have a clear path of action.
- [ ] Loading skeletons transition smoothly into empty states (or data).
- [ ] Responsive behavior: Center-aligned messaging on mobile.
