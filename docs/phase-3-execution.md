## Executive Summary
Phase 3 transitions the user from a "Discovery" phase to an "Execution" phase. The wizard culminates in a persistent Strategic Hub (Dashboard) where the roadmap becomes a living document.

## Analysis & Logic

### 1. From Roadmap to Reality
Screen 5 currently generates a static text roadmap. Phase 3 turns these "Outcomes" into actionable tasks.
- **Logic:** Each Roadmap Phase is decomposed into weekly milestones.

### 2. Readiness Gap Remediation
The "Gap Analysis" from Screen 4 becomes the "Day 1-30" priority list. 
- **Value:** Sun AI doesn't just point out problems; it creates the "Foundation Phase" of the roadmap specifically to fix those gaps.

### 3. Strategic Hub (Dashboard)
The post-wizard experience is a minimalist Command Center.
- **Systems Overview:** Status of implemented AI systems.
- **Intelligence Feed:** Ongoing AI-generated suggestions based on progress.
- **The "Executive View":** High-level metrics on Revenue Impact and Speed of Execution.

### 4. Data Continuity
Persistence is implemented to ensure that a founder can return to their strategy months later. The context is "locked" until a "System Re-evaluation" is triggered.
