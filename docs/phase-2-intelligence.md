## Executive Summary
Phase 2 elevates the platform from a "smart form" to a "deep reasoning engine." By integrating Gemini 3's advanced features—specifically Google Search grounding and Thinking budgets—Sun AI will provide insights that are verified against the real web and structured through complex reasoning.

## Analysis & Logic

### 1. Verification via Search
In Screen 1, the AI will use the `googleSearch` tool to verify the company's website and market reputation. 
- **Value:** The right panel will display: "We've verified your market positioning against competitors..." and provide clickable citations. This builds massive authority.

### 2. Thinking-Driven Diagnostics
Screens 2 and 4 will utilize a Thinking Budget (2048-4096 tokens).
- **Reasoning:** Instead of a simple mapping, the model will reason through *why* a specific operational bottleneck (e.g., slow proposal turnaround) leads to a specific readiness gap (e.g., lack of structured CRM data).

### 3. Screen 3: The Recommendation Logic
The current hardcoded cards will be replaced by a dynamic "System Architect" agent.
- **Logic:** It will cross-reference Screen 2 priorities with a system library. If a user prioritizes "Time Savings" and identifies "Manual content work" as a blocker, the AI will synthesize a "Content Supply Chain" system recommendation.

### 4. The Streaming Experience
Using `generateContentStream`, the Right Panel will feel "alive." As the user types in the Center, the "Consultant" on the Right is "taking notes" in real-time.
